This project was inspired by the PDE generator by Adam Parrish

Here are some experiments I've done based on the PDEGenerator by Adam Parrish of decontextualize.com. 
There are several experiments going on here:-
This is my first NetBeans 7.0.1 git project,
I'm using the coin features of jdk 7.0, so I've converted a chain of if else (on String) to a switch etc.
The main feature that I have changed / added is to add the possiblity of weighted rules. 
By default each rule/option is given a weighting of 1.0f.
The other thing I've added is the ability to limit recursion. I also produce pyprocessing and 3D pde variants.
